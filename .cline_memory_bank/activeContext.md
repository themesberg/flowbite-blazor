# Active Context

## Current Task
Awaiting next component assignment from the project roadmap.

## Recent Changes
1.  Completed the Toast component by fixing multiple issues, including icon rendering, duplicate toasts on the demo page, a positioning bug, and default styling visibility.
2.  Implemented a `HostId` system to allow for multiple `ToastHost` components.
3.  Corrected the rendering of component lists by adding the `@key` directive.
4.  Updated `.clinerules` to include a strict policy on using only internal icon libraries.

## Current Status
The Toast component is now considered complete and working as expected. All known issues have been resolved.

## Next Steps
1.  Consult the `progress.md` file to identify the next component to be implemented from the "To Do" list.
2.  Begin the implementation process for the new component, following the established project patterns.
