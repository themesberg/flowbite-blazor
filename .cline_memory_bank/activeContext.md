# Active Context

## Current Task
Continuing to fix issues with the Toast component.

## Recent Changes
1.  Replaced incorrect Font Awesome icons in the Toast component with the correct, internal `Flowbite.Icons`.
2.  Corrected the `ToastPage.razor` demo page to use the proper `ToastService` helper methods (`ShowSuccess`, `ShowError`, etc.).
3.  Updated `.clinerules` to include a strict policy on using only internal icon libraries.

## Current Status
The Toast component implementation is still in progress. The initial set of identified issues has been resolved, but more fixes are required.

## Next Steps
1.  Ask the user to articulate the remaining issues with the Toast component.
2.  Address the issues identified by the user.
